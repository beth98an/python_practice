# Python practice

# Create a function called greetings that takes one argument as string and returns the name
# def greetings(name):
#     return name
#
# print(greetings("bob"))

# # Declare a list of numbers from 1 to 9 iterate through the list and print the list
# num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# for num in num_list:
#     print(num)

# # Write the boolean operators
# # if a == b and c == d: print(TRUE)
# if "a" == "b" and "c" == "d":
#     print(True)

# create a list of five numbers starting from 0
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# create a tuple with the same information
num_tuple = tuple(numbers)

# change the value to the tuple in the last index

# cannot change a tuple
# because tuples are IMMUTABLE
# unlike lists, that can be changed as they are MUTABLE
