# Python practice

# Create a function called greetings that takes one argument as string and returns the name
# def greetings(name):
#     return name
#
# print(greetings("bob"))

# # Declare a list of numbers from 1 to 9 iterate through the list and print the list
# num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# for num in num_list:
#     print(num)
